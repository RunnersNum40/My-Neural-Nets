    """Class for Xavier normal initializer.

    Xavier initalization is commonly used for initializing the weights of a
    layer that has the sigmoid or tanh activation function. The weights are
    initialized randomly from a normal distribution with the specified mean and
    standard deviation. The mean and standard deviation are calculated as
    follows:

    mean = 0
    std = sqrt(2 / (num_inputs + num_outputs))

    where num_inputs is the number of inputs to the layer and num_outputs is
    the number of outputs from the layer.
